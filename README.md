# Scradd

## About

Scradd is a custom all-in-one Discord bot for the [Scratch Addons (SA) server](https://discord.gg/FPv957V6SD). It has
many features, such as punishments, auto moderation, “potatoboard”, XP, and much more. It also has many features
specific to Scratch Addons, including addon search, suggestion utilities, fun games, tons of inside jokes, and more.

## Setup

### Create a bot

1. Visit [the Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
2. Note the “Application ID” for future use.
3. Go to the “Bot” tab and add a bot to the app.
4. Highly recommended: Disable the “Public Bot” switch so random people don’t add it to their servers.
5. Make sure to toggle all three of the Privileged Gateway Intents (the Presence, Server Members, and Message Content
   Intents) on.
6. Click “Reset Token” and note it for future use.

### Set up the testing server

1. Create a new server using the [Scradd Testing server template](https://discord.new/htbTxKBq6EVp).
2. Enable Community in Server Settings. Use `#info` for the Rules or Guidelines channel and `#mod-logs` for the
   Community Updates Channel.
3. Enable Developer Mode under User Settings → Advanced.
4. Right-click on your new testing server, copy its ID, and note it for future use.
5. Invite your bot at
   `https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[APPLICATION_ID_HERE]&guild_id=[SERVER_ID_HERE]&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot`

### Set up MongoDB

1. [Make a MongoDB account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) if you don't already have one.
2. When asked to deploy a cluster, select a free M0 cluster and name it Scradd. All other default settings are fine.
3. Choose to authenticate with a username and password. What you set them to doesn't matter. Note the password for
   future use.
4. Choose connecting from your local environment and add your current IP address to the list. If you expect to develop
   from many locations, you can alternatively add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow any IPs to connect.
5. Once the cluster is created, select “Get connection string” under “Application Development”. Copy the connection
   string from the modal (probably under step 3), replace `<password>` with your password, and note it for future use.

### Set up the repository locally

1. Download [git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) if you haven’t already.
2. Clone the repository using the `git clone` command.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Set up the .env file as described in
   [`global.d.ts`](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ascratchaddons-community%2Fscradd+path%3Aglobal.d.ts+ProcessEnv&type=code).
5. Code!

## Development

### File structure

This bot is built using [strife.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strife.js) and follows its recommended style guide and
structure. In addition, the `common` directory contains code used across multiple features, and the `util` directory
contains utility functions used across the codebase. `util` is different from `common` as its functions are not specific
to this bot but could be useful in other apps as well.

### Commands

Scradd has a couple of dev commands to streamline your coding.

-   `npm run build`: One-time build with TypeScript
-   `npm run start`: Run the bot
-   `npm run dev`: Rebuild with TypeScript on each code change
-   `npm run serve`: Run the bot and restart with nodemon on each successful build
-   `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier
-   `npm run lint`: Lint code with ESLint
-   `npm run test`: Run unit tests with the Node.js native test runner

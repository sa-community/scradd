# Contributing guidelines

For anyone who knows [Git](https://git-scm.com) and TypeScript/JavaScript basics: feel free to contribute to this
repository! Our code is open source. Be sure to follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Anyone who has a
meaningful pull request merged may also receive one or more of the following:

-   `@Scradd Contributor` role in the Scratch Addons server
-   access to the private Scradd Testing server
-   credit under `/credits`

## General guidelines

Please:

-   Follow [the code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
-   Stay on topic. Use the SA server for random chatting, that's basically why it exists.
-   Use reactions instead of meaningless comments, or in other words, üëç reactions instead of ‚ÄúGood idea‚Äù comments.

## Filing [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues)

Feel free to report bugs and request features in an issue. Be sure to check if it is already reported by using the
search bar [here](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/issues). If there are no similar issues, you can
create a new one. We will take a look at it.

## Creating [pull requests (PRs)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

Contributions are welcome! However, before coding new features, please discuss it with cobalt, whether that be in an
issue here or somewhere on Discord.

### Selecting an issue

The [issues section](https://github.com/scratchaddons-community/scradd/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen) is my TODO list.
If I am assigned, that means I would like to do this myself, but if you would strongly prefer to do it, leave a comment
and we could figure something out. If it's unassigned, it's something I want that you may take up without asking -- just
leave a comment saying you‚Äôll do it. Things with the "status: help wanted" label are things I don't care if they are
added or not, and I won't code them. They'll only happen if someone else does it.

Please prioritize issues attached to milestones, especially the sooner versions.

### Contributing code

When you‚Äôre ready to contribute, you can create a pull request. Fork this repository and create a new branch from the
`main` branch. Set up your testing environment as documented [in the README](/README.md#setup) and make your changes to
the new branch. Now, create a pull request on the origin repository (scratchaddons-community/scradd). We will review
your pull request. Please make sure to include `Resolves #123` in the pull request description, where `#123` is the
appropriate issue number. That will cause GitHub to automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.

Please:

-   Minimize the number of `@ts-` comments you use, and if you must use one, use `@ts-expect-error`.
-   Format your code by using `npm run format` before pushing. If you don‚Äôt, it may be automatically run in the
    workflow.
-   Lint your code by using `npm run lint`. No lint errors may be present when your PR is merged. Warnings may be
    allowed depending on the context. Some lint errors may be fixed automatically with `npm run lint -- --fix`, but it
    is important to manually confirm it worked as intended. The workflow fails if any errors are present.
-   Rerun the unit tests by using `npm run test`. Make sure the unit tests continue to succeed. No tests may fail when
    your PR is merged. We would also very much appreciate any new tests you add if you could. We use the Node.js native
    test runner for tests.

To test your code, it‚Äôs easiest to run `npm run serve & npm run dev` in my opinion. That runs both TypeScript and
nodemon on watch mode, to attempt to rebuild your code on every change, and to restart the bot on every successful
build. Using this setup, you hardly ever need to touch the terminal, and there's only one place you need to look for
error logs.

Before committing your code, it is necessary to run `npm run format`, then `npm run lint` and fix any lint errors,
finally `npm run test` and fix any failing tests, then repeat all three until no more lint errors are left.
